# My Role
I collaborated with other UI Developer in my team to develop this application, My task was to populate the user interface with data retrieved from firebase database and add functionality to components like button 
and links. I worked with React, react-hooks , react-router and firebase to fetch and send data, update state and display it on user interface and route components. I also used web api to build notification feature in this application
